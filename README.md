## Hyperspectral datasets
Several public hyperspectral datasets are available on [EHU](https://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes). Users can download those beforehand. 

An example dataset folder has the following structure:
```
Datasets
├── Indian Pines
│   ├── Indian_pines_corrected.mat
│   ├── Indian_pines_gt.mat
```
